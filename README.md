## Description

I created Bastubook a few years ago to automate the booking of sauna times.
My local sauna became a popular place and bookings were hard to come by, so
I needed something to book time slots as soon as they were released, and it 
was also a fun challenge at the time. It takes data such as name, email 
address and phone number from a yaml file and then feeds it into website forms 
using Selenium. I have not used it for years, so I doubt it still works as is, 
but I will keep it here in case someone finds it useful.
